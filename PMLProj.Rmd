#Getting and Cleaning Data
```{r}
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", header = TRUE)
test  <- read.csv('pml-testing.csv')
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
